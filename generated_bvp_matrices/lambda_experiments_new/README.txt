Ran on CÃ©drics Laptop with precision e-9. Uses the new carp algorithm which combines relaxation and nonzero. keeps running even if no result is found. Goes up to 50k iterations until max reached.

has values:
-1 : if converged until 50k iterations
-2 : after 10 "out of iterations" in a row, the rest gets skipped and -2 will be inserted for all the remaining values
